**Choose from 2 of the 3 classifiers:**
- **MLP**, **CNN** or **RNN**

- Maybe we choose MLP and CNN, but here are some key points:

- **Data Type (Audio)**

    - **MLP:** Typically handles vectorized data well, **meaning you would have to convert audio into a feature vector** (possibly using MFCCs or other feature extraction techniques). However, it may struggle to capture spatial or temporal dependencies in the data compared to CNNs.

    - **CNN:** More adept at **handling spatial data and is very effective for feature extraction** from time-frequency representations like spectrograms or MFCCs. Given that audio data can be represented as 2D images (spectrograms), CNNs are **naturally suited for this.**

- **Preprocessing:**

    - **MLP:** Requires **extensive preprocessing and feature extraction** since it cannot process raw audio efficiently. We'd need to **extract features like MFCCs** or other statistical properties before feeding the data into the MLP.

    - **CNN:** Allows for **direct use of raw audio or spectrograms**, minimizing the need for complex feature engineering. It will **automatically learn relevant features** from the input data.

  1. **Introduction**

    - **Objective:** Introduce the purpose of the assignment, which is to classify urban sounds using deep learning models.

    - **Dataset Overview:** Briefly describe the UrbanSound8K dataset, its classes (e.g., air conditioner, dog bark, etc.), and the challenge of audio classification.

    - **Problem Statement:** State the main goal of developing models that can classify these sound categories accurately.

2. **Data Understanding**

    - **Exploration of the Dataset:** Provide an overview of the dataset structure (number of samples, classes, duration of audio clips, etc.). Visualize some aspects of the data (e.g., distribution of classes, duration of clips).

    - **Audio Features:** Explain the different types of features used in audio analysis (e.g., raw waveform, MFCC, spectrograms). Justify the chosen features for the models (e.g., why you use MFCC or spectrogram for CNN).

3. **Data Preprocessing**

    - **Loading and Processing Audio Data:** Detail the steps taken to load the audio files and preprocess them (e.g., normalization, sampling rates).

    - **Feature Extraction:** Explain the extraction of relevant features (e.g., MFCCs for MLP, spectrograms for CNN).

    - **Train-Test Split:** Outline how you separate the data into training, validation, and test sets (using 10-fold cross-validation as required by the project).

4. **Model Selection**

    - **Choosing Models:** Briefly discuss the rationale for selecting MLP and CNN as your two deep learning approaches.

    - **Model Architectures:**
        - **MLP:** Describe how you define the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions for MLP.
        - **CNN:** Detail how you design the CNN model, including the choice of 1D vs. 2D input (e.g., using spectrograms), convolutional layers, filters, and pooling.

5. **Model Training and Optimization**

    - **Training Strategy:** Discuss the training process, including optimizer selection (e.g., Adam), learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
    Mention any regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, early stopping) used to prevent overfitting.

    - **Evaluation Metrics:** Explain the metrics you will use to evaluate the performance of the models (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix, cross-validation results).

6. **Results and Discussion**
    - **Performance Comparison:** Present the classification results for both MLP and CNN models, including accuracy and confusion matrices.
    Discuss which model performed better and why, focusing on any challenges encountered.

    - **Error Analysis:** Analyze the types of misclassifications and whether certain classes were harder to classify.

7. **Conclusion**
    - **Summary:** Summarize the key findings of your project.
    - **Future Work:** Suggest possible improvements (e.g., trying different architectures, implementing transfer learning, using RNNs).

8. **Bonus (if applicable)**
    - **Adversarial Robustness:** If applicable, discuss any experiments with adversarial examples (e.g., using DeepFool) and how they affect the classifier's performance.
